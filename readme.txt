Enable WordPress blocks to display dynamic data that auto-updates on the frontend of your site.

== Description ==

Simply select a block in the WordPress editor, toggle on Dynamic Content, and select the custom field (aka post meta key) that contains the value you'd like to display. If that value changes in your database, it will automatically reflect the change on the frontend of your site.

The following blocks are currently supported:
* Paragraph
* Heading
* Verse

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with ACF (Advanced Custom Fields)? =

Absolutely! Works with regular custom fields or ACF.

= Can I have just a section of text dynamic? =

Not yet! Currently the dynamic value will take over the entire block.

== Screenshots ==

1. View of the editor with Dynamic Content enabled on a paragraph block.
